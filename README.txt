Project Title: Tank Turmoil

Tank Turmoil is a 1v1 multiplayer game that enables two players to play as opponent tanks on a randomly generated battlefield. Using keyboard and touchpad as sources of inputs, the players can move/turn the tanks, fire different types of weapons, and claim special power-ups that are randomly spawned on the map after a fixed interval of time. The borders and walls of the battlefield will stop tanks from moving forward, and weapons bounce off the walls and flies in hard-to-predict trajectories. All of this contributes to a chaotic battlefield environment. Remember, you may hit by ANY WEAPON regardless of FROM WHERE OR FROM WHOM it is. You only got ONE life. Have fun!

Run Instructions: No external modules are used, so the program should be able to run as long as cmu_graphics is installed at the right place.

Shortcut Commands: None
***Necessary instructions on how to play the game are all displayed in the game
===============================================
On a personal note, some technologies and concepts used to realize features in the game that I think is worth mentioning:
-Recursion and backtracking (e.g. randomly generating the battlefield and generating the laser weapon)
-Cross Product testing (dot-rectangle overlap testing) used to check whether the tank, a potentially rotated rectangle, is hit by any existing weapons on the battlefield.

Tips: if you have time, try to click as many times as possible on the ratings of this game! Either minus or plus works!
